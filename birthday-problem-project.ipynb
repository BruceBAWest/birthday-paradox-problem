    "\n",
    "1. First write a for loop that dynamically assigns random birthdays (days 1 through 365)  to an array the size of the number of people you are considering.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "2. AFTER THAT WORKS:\n",
    "    * Then write a function that compares the elements of the array to see if any of them are equal, and if you find a set of elements that match, terminate the for loop and increment a global variable (to record that the trial had at least two matching birthdays),\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "3. AFTER THAT WORKS:\n",
    "    * Then in close the previous two for loops in a master for loop that runs the experiment 1000 times, and that has the global variable outside the master for loop.\n",

    "#### Then we set the default number of matches in the group to zero with:\n",
    "    `matchyMatchy = 0`\n",
    "___\n",
    "#### Now we start our master loop, `trial`. This is what runs everything 1000 times, as set in `range(trialCount)`\n",
    "___\n",
    "#### Inside the *for loop* we create a list of birthdays using the *list method* with: <br>\n",
    "`birthdayList = []\n",
    "for i in range(groupSize):\n",
    "    newBDay = random.randrange(365)\n",
    "    birthdayList.append(newBDay)`\n",
    "\n",

    "#### Next we use the *count* method to find duplicates in the list with:<br>\n",
    "`foundMatch = False\n",

    "    if birthdayList.count(num) > 1:\n",

    "<br>In the above, we first create and set `foundMatch` to default as `False`.<br>\n",
    "<br>Then we look for any given number, `num`, in `birthdayList` which occurs more than once with:<br>\n",
